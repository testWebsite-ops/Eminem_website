                        <h3>Synopsis</h3>
                        <p>Born on October 17, 1972, in St. Joseph, Missouri, rap musician Eminem had a turbulent
                            childhood. He released The Slim Shady LP in early 1999, and the album went multi-platinum,
                            garnering Eminem two Grammy Awards and four MTV Video Music Awards. In 2000, the rapper
                            released The Marshall Mathers LP, which was noted as the fastest-selling album in rap
                            history. More recently, in 2010, Eminem released the Grammy-winning album Recovery, a highly
                            autobiographical attempt to come to terms with his struggles with addiction and experience
                            with rehabilitation. Eminem plans to release his eighth album, MMLP2, in 2013.</p>

                        <h3> Career Highlights</h3>
                        <p>A year later, however, Eminem released The Slim Shady EP, which was discovered by Dr. Dre,
                            the legendary rapper and former producer of Eminem's favorite rap group N.W.A. After Eminem
                            traveled to Los Angeles and became runner-up in the 1997 Rap Olympics MC Battle, Dre
                            listened to the rapper's cassette in the basement of executive Jimmy Iovine's home. Dre was
                            so impressed that he signed Eminem to his Interscope Records label. In 1999, after two years
                            of working with Dre, Eminem released The Slim Shady LP. The heavily hyped record became an
                            instant success and went on to sell over three million copies. Eminem's first single, "My
                            Name Is," mixed a childish humor and energy with rampant profanity and flashes of violenceâ€”a
                            potent and fascinating combination that felt different from anything else in rap. Marshall
                            and Kim Mathers married later that same year.</p>

                        <p>Eminem released his second studio album, The Marshall Mathers LP, in May 2000. The album
                            showed off Eminem's poetic talents as well as his emotional and artistic range. His songs
                            vary from manically funny ("The Real Slim Shady") to heartbreakingly poignant ("Stan") to
                            explosively violent ("Kim") to disarmingly self-critical ("The Way I Am"). The Marshall
                            Mathers LP sold over 19 million copies worldwide, won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album,
                            received a nomination for Album of the Year and is widely considered among the greatest rap
                            albums of all time.</p>

                        <p>Nevertheless, The Marshall Mathers LP also came under a firestorm of criticism for its
                            excessive profanity, glorification of drugs and violence and its apparent homophobia and
                            misogyny. While Eminem attempted to mitigate such criticism by maintaining that his raps
                            simply use the rough language he has been surrounded by since childhood, and later by
                            performing a duet with Elton John at the Grammy Awards to demonstrate his openness to the
                            gay community, Eminem nevertheless remains widely reviled in some quarters for his offensive
                            lyrical content.</p>

                        <p>In 2001, Eminem reconnected with several of his friends from the Detroit underground rap
                            scene to form the group D12, recording an album called Devil's Night featuring the popular
                            single "Purple Pills." A year later, Eminem released a new solo album, The Eminem Show,
                            another popular and critically acclaimed album highlighted by the tracks "Without Me,"
                            "Cleaning Out my Closet" and "Sing for the Moment." His next album, 2004's Encore, was less
                            successful than his previous efforts, but still featured popular songs such as "Like Toy
                            Soldiers" and "Mockingbird."</p>
